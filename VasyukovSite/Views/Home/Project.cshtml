                The program is build using WPF with the Material Design flavor. It's purpose is to provide connections between colleagues who are trying to order some food in office. Through using duplex WCF building, "dualHttpBinding" it is creating counting server, where participants picking their desirable items in food delivery store, picking discount they want to apply and when they finished, this program calculating their order making ordering process a lot easier. Right now this program works with lan network only. Handy search feature can look for servers of this program within your local net. In future I'll develop remote API for this program. So it will decrease admin prerequisites off participant who lead his server.
